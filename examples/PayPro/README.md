# Running the Payment Protocol Demo
This is an example of Bitcore's Payment Protocol implementation, including a
mocked server (`server.js`) and client (`customer.js`).

1. Start the server: `node server.js`
2. Start the customer: `node customer.js`

At this point, you should see an acknowledgement from your local server:

```
Customer: Our payment was acknowledged!
Customer: Message from Merchant: Thank you for your payment!
Customer: Payment sent successfully.
```
